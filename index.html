This is a Copilot convention that helps you identify:

- **Filename** (so you know which file to update)
- **File's source URL in your repository** (for provenance and reference)

It also ensures GitHub Copilot shows contextually relevant answers. This line is not part of your code.  
You do **not** copy that first line into your codebase—just everything *after* it.

## Example:
```html name=index.html url=https://github.com/chakravarthypoondru/ChakravarthyPoondru.github.io/blob/main/index.html
<!-- Everything below this line is the code you copy/update -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
...
</html>
